  White House press secretary Sean Spicer said:
  <blockquote>
    Thereâ€™s 109 people that were slowed down, over 300,000 foreign visitors that
    came in.
  </blockquote>
  The 109 figure came up again and again. It was later revealed the number was
  higher (and it's not clear where the 109 number came from). This is to say
  nothing of the reported-over-100,000 visas totally canceled, as reported a few
  days later in court.

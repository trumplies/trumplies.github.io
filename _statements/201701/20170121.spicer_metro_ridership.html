  White House press secretary Sean Spicer claims more people rode the DC Metro
  the day of Trumps inauguration than did for Obama's 2013 inauguration.

  False. He claims 317,000 rode it for for President Obamaâ€™s 2013 inaugural
  celebration, when in reality it was 783,000. This one actually appears to be
  probably an honest (but lazy) mistake, however. The DC Metro tweeted "Metro
  Ridership: As of 11am, 193k trips taken so far today. (11am 1/20/13 = 317k,
  11am 1/20/09 = 513k, 11am 1/20/05 = 197k) #wmata" and then, subsequently, ".
  CORRECTION: The 317k figure above was from 1/21/13 (Inauguration Day)." This
  317k figure, that is, is the number of riders as of 11am on 1/21/13, not on
  the entire day, which is what Spicer claims.

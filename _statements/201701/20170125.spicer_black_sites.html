  White House press secretary Sean Spicer claims that Trump has not drafted an
  order allowing the CIA to repoen "black site" prisons, and a circulating draft
  claiming otherwise is not a White House document.

  News sites are reporting otherwise, based on a published draft order. The New
  York times says, of Spicer's account,
  <blockquote>
  But the three administration officials familiar with the document, who
  discussed internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity, portrayed that
  account as false. They said the White House had circulated the draft order
  among national security staff members in the same way that a flurry of other
  pending executive orders had been distributed for review: with no warning and
  scant time to provide comments.
  </blockquote>

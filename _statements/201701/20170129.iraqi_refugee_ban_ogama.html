truth_status: >
  Trump, in an official written statement, said:
  <blockquote>
    My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned
    visas for refugees from Iraq for six months
  </blockquote>
  Despite the fact that Obama shifted policies in 2011 to vet Iraqi refugees
  more thoroughly and therefore made the immigration process longer, there was
  never a ban on Iraqi visas.

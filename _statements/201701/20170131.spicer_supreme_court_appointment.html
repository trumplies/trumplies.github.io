  late in a Presidential election cycle as Merrick Garland was.

  White House press secretary Sean Spicer said:
  <blockquote>
    There’s never been a situation in which you had a fourth term, someone that
    late in an election cycle. That had never occurred before.
    And I think the Senate Republicans were very clear that we should wait and
    let the voters have a choice. And that’s exactly what happened.
  </blockquote>
  Clearly the claim that this happened in Obama's fourth term was a slip of the
  tongue. The claim, however, is that it was a legitimate move to block Merrick
  Garland's SCOTUS appointment wholesale since the lateness of the appointment
  in the President's term was unprecedented. As Kevin M. Kruse said on Twitter,
  <blockquote>
    Setting aside the point that the timing issue is a moronic excuse, Merrick
    Garland was nominated on March 16th of Obama's last year.
    On June 26th of his last year in office, LBJ nominated Abe Fortas to be the
    new Chief Justice and Homer Thornberry to replace Fortas
    I guess we should give him credit for not trotting out the talking point
    that there's "no tradition" of SCOTUS noms in an election year?
    But since that ahistorical nonsense is likely to come up somewhere else,
    let's repeat this history one more time:
    Reagan nominated Anthony Kennedy on 11/30/87, within a year of the 1988
    presidential election, and he was confirmed on 2/3/88
    Eisenhower appointed William Brennan to the court -- by a recess
    appointment! -- just weeks before the 1956 presidential election.
    FDR nominated Frank Murphy to the Supreme Court in an election year, on
    January 4, 1940, and he was confirmed just two weeks later.
    Herbert Hoover nominated Benjamin Cardozo to the Supreme Court in an
    election year, on Feb. 15, 1932. He was confirmed nine days later.
    Woodrow Wilson nominated John Clarke to the Supreme Court in an election
    year, on July 14, 1916. He was confirmed ten days later.
    Woodrow Wilson also nominated Louis Brandeis to the Supreme Court earlier
    that same election year, on Jan. 28, 1916. Confirmed in June.
    William Howard Taft nominated Mahlon Pitney to the Supreme Court in an
    election year, on February 19, 1912. Confirmed the next month.
    Benjamin Harrison nominated George Shiras Jr. to the Supreme Court in an
    election year, on July 19, 1882. Confirmed a week later.
    And on and on. There are countless examples of a SCOTUS nomination being
    made in an election year and the Senate acting quickly on it.
  </blockquote>
  Kruse continued, later,
  <blockquote>
    I confined my examples here to the last century, but since @PressSec said
    "never," I'll follow up with a few more:
    John Adams nominated the famous Chief Justice John Marshall on January 20,
    1801 -- months *after* he lost the election to Jefferson.
    John Quincy Adams nominated John Crittenden on December 17, 1828, after he
    lost the election to Jackson. He was confirmed.
    Martin Van Buren nominated Peter Daniel on February 26, 1841, after losing
    to WHHarrison. Confirmed weeks before WHH sworn in.
    These presidents nominated justices even after they lost the election.
    Unlike Obama with a full year left, they were *true* lame ducks.

  In an interview with Fox News, Conway said:
  <blockquote>
    325,000 people from overseas came into this country just yesterday through
    our airports....You're talking about 300 and some who have been detained
    or are prevented from gaining access to an aircraft in their home
    countries. Thats 1 percent. And I think in terms of the upside being greater
    protection of our borders, of our people, it's a small price to pay.
  </blockquote>
  Bizarelly, this is actually a little under 0.1% (do the math), so her case is
  actually <i>stronger </i> than she states (though the author takes umbrage
  with the argument, but that is out of scope). Arithmetic errors shouldn't
  usually count as "lies," certainly, but she is defending and reasoning about
  policy based on this one!

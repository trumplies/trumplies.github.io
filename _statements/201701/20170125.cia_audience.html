  In response to a question on the controversy that the crowds vigorously
  applauding at his CIA speech were Trump plants, Trump said
  <blockquote>
    They showed the people applauding and screaming and -- and they were all
    CIA. There was -- somebody was asking Sean -- "Well, were they Trump people
    that were put--" we don't have Trump people. They were CIA people.
  </blockquote>
  White House press secretary Sean Spicer admitted Trump brought at least 10
  people, and some indicate there were more (but there's no firm verification of
  that).

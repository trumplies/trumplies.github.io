  In the first daily press conference of the administration, White House press
  secretary Sean Spicer claimed the global gag order signed by Trump will "end
  the use of taxpayer dollars to fund abortions overseas, along with coercive
  abortion and sterilization practices." In fact, this policy has already
  strictly been in place since 1973, and is called the Helms Amendment. The
  global gag order, instead, defunds organizations if they even mention abortion
  as an option to women.

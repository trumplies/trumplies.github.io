  In fact, police report there have been 37 murders in Chicago to date.
  Trump tweeted "If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible 'carnage' going on, 228
  shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the
  Feds!" In fact, "[p]olice said there have been 37 murders in Chicago so far
  this year," reported ABC news Chicago earlier today. It's not entirely clear
  where the 42 figure comes from.

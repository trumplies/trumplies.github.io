  Trump says the New York Times lost many subscribers due to the 2016 Election.

  In an interview with David Brody, Trump said:
  <blockquote>
    [The New York Times] actually apologized to their readers. They lost a lot
    of subscriptions not because their readers even like me, they said how
    inaccurate could you be? Because if you read The New York Times, there was
    no chance that Trump was going to win.
  </blockquote>
  It's somewhat unclear what this string of words means, but, in any case,
  subscriptions to the New York Times increased quite a bit after the election,
  far outpacing any lost subscriptions.

  White House press secretary Sean Spicer said:
  <blockquote>
    The language that's part of the president's memo is identical to the
    language for Presidents Bush's 2001.
    The only thing that's changed in this is the addition of the Director of
    National Intelligence as a position that didn't exist in 2001. For what it's
    worth, it's the same as Obama's, save for the word "also."
  </blockquote>
  This is in response to concerns about the reported addition of Chief
  Strategist Steve Bannon to the council. Politifact (see link below) does a
  good job of enumerating the ways in which, in fact, Trump's NSC is quite a bit
  different from Obama's and Bush's.

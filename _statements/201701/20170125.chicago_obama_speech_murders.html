  In an ABC interview Trump said:
  <blockquote>
    So, look, when President Obama was there two weeks ago making a speech, very
    nice speech. Two people were shot and killed during his speech. You can't
    have that....They weren't shot at the speech. But they were shot in the
    city of Chicago during his speech.
  </blockquote>
  This is false. According to the Chicago Tribune:
  <blockquote>
    According to the Tribune database, the city had no slayings for about 24
    hours before and after Obama's speech, which lasted from 8:02 to 8:53 p.m. A
    man was shot about 20 minutes after the speech about eight miles away in the
    West Side's Lawndale neighborhood, but that victim survived, according to
    Police Department data.
  </blockquote>

  Trump claims the first author of a 2012 Pew report that the administration has
  falsely claimed supports claims of widespread voter fraud was "groveling" when
  he says the report doesn't support these claims.

truth_status: >
  The first author has been consistently on the record as saying his report does
  not support claims of widespread voter fraud. It's unclear what Trump even
  means here ("Then heâ€™s groveling again. You know I always talk about the
  reporters that grovel when they want to write something that you want to hear
  but not necessarily millions of people want to hear or have to hear.") If what
  he means is that the author is kowtowing to a bunch of press bullies, that
  certainly doesn't seem at all substantiated.

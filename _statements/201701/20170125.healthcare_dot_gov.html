  In an ABC Interview, Trump says
  <blockquote>
    And now those people in many cases don't even have health care. They don't
    even have anything that's acceptable to them. Remember this, keep your
    doctor, keep your plan, 100 percent. Remember the $5 billion website?
    Remember the website fiasco. I mean, you do admit that I think, right? The
    website fiasco.
  </blockquote>
  The site actually cost somewhere around $2B. Even the National Review, when
  decrying the site for being expensive, doesn't claim it cost more than $2.1B.

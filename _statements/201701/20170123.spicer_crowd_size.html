  In the second press conference of the administration, White House press
  secretary Sean Spicer claimed, without evidence, that "tens of millions of
  people" watched the event online. Estimates based on the traffic of the CDN
  that processed almost all the global traffic for the event put the number at
  closer to 5 million.

note: >
  Despite the fact that this is a remarkably confusing and unimportant thing to
  be arguing about, many reporters (and much of the public more generally) were
  still quite confused about the false claims about inaugural crowd size from
  the antagonistic presser a few days prior, and it seems important to the
  President, so Spicer doubled down.

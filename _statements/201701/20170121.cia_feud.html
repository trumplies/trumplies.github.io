  President Trump, speaking to the CIA the day after his inauguration, said
  "They [the news media] sort of made it sound like I had a 'feud' with the
  intelligence community. It is exactly the opposite, and they understand that,
  too." In fact, between being elected and inaugurated, Trump repeatedly and
  publicly denied the intelligence's community's basic competence. "These are
  the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction," his
  transition team said in a statement. "Intelligence agencies should never have
  allowed this fake news to 'leak' into the public. One last shot at me.Are we
  living in Nazi Germany?" Trump tweeted.

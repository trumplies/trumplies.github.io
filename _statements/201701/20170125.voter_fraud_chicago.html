  In an ABC interview Trump said
  <blockquote>
    But take a look at the tape of Barack Obama who wrote me, by the way, a very
    beautiful letter in the drawer of the desk. Very beautiful. And I appreciate
    it. But look at what he said, it's on tape. Look at what he said about
    voting in Chicago eight years ago. It's not changed. It hasn't changed,
    believe me. Chicago, look what's going on in Chicago. It's only gotten
    worse.
  </blockquote>
  There is no evidence of this.

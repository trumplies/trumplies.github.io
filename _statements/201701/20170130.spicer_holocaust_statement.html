  mention Jews have been "by and large...praised."

  Regarding the statement in question, White House press secretary Sean Spicer
  said:
  <blockquote>
    He’s aware of what people have been saying, but I think by and large he’s
    been praised for it.
  </blockquote>
  Though this is, in some sense, a matter of interpretation and opinion rather
  than fact, there certainly appears to be, at the time, a fairly broad-based
  disagreement about its general correctness. Certainly a number of high-profile
  white nationalists praised the statement, but this thankfully constitutes a
  very small minority.

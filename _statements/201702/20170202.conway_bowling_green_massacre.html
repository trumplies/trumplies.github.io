  In an interview with Chris Matthews, Presidential Advisor Kellyanne Conway
  said:
  <blockquote>
    I bet it’s brand new information to people that President Obama had a
    six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqi refugees came
    here to this country, were radicalized and were the masterminds behind the
    Bowling Green massacre. Most people don’t know that because it didn’t get
    covered.
  </blockquote>
  Though it beggars belief to imagine a presidential spokesperson inventing
  massacres from whole cloth to support an agenda, there was never any such
  massacre. She later claimed it was an honest mistake.

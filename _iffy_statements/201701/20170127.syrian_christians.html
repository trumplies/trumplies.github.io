  Trump says that, in recent years, it has been "almost impossible" for
  Christian Syrians to get into the United States

  In an interview with David Brody, Trump said:
  <blockquote>
    Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least
    very tough to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could
    come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the
    reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but
    they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians.
  </blockquote>
  Suffice it to say, this is a complicated issue, and while the percentage of
  Christian asylum seekers from Syria is less than the percentage of Christian
  Syrians, the possible reasons for this are many. The Washington Post does a
  good job of analyzing.

  For what it's worth, a part of the more general narrative at the time is "it's
  harder in general for Christians to get asylum in the US," which is not
  clearly borne out by the numbers.

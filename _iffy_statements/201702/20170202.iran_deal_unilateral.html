  Trump tweeted:
  <blockquote>
    Iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the U.S. came along
    and gave it a life-line in the form of the Iran Deal: $150 billion
  </blockquote>
  This intimates the US is the only non-Iranian signatory to the deal. In fact,
  the deal involved the five permanent members of the UN Security Council
  (China, France, Russia, the UK, and the US) and Germany.

  <h1> About The Trump Lie Logs </h1>
  <div class="row padtop"> <div class="col-md-6">
This is meant to be a single compendium documenting the lies and untruths told
by Trump and his administration since he assumed office, alongside sources. This
list is bound to be incomplete, but we'll try!
</div> </div>
<div class="row padtop"> <div class="col-md-6">
We'll let others do the subtle analysis of The Nature Of Truth needed to really
thoroughly fact-check things; we're instead merely trying to put all the
administration's mistruths in one place, alongside some sources.
</div> </div>
<div class="row padtop"> <div class="col-md-6">
Claims purportedly supported by "evidence" that is vaguely referred to but
neither named nor described are assumed to have no evidentiary basis. This is
stricter than the burden of proof required of somebody you're chatting with at a
bar or at a a baseball game, but we're not at a baseball game.
</div> </div>
<div class="row padtop"> <div class="col-md-6">
We highly encourage you to read many sources on these matters! Don't take
our word!
